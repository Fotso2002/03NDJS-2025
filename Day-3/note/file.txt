Objectives
 Create a structure RESTFUL API using Express.js 
  A RESTFUL API is a server that permit us to to make a CRUD
   Express.js skilss;
      RESTful APIs. Express.js is widely used to design scalable, 
      production-ready RESTful APIs. The framework's routing and middleware

         starting a mongoose db command;
         "nmp init -y" to start the nodejs project
         "npm install mongoose" to initialise the package for the db
         "npm install express" to install express framework
         next we create a folder db, then inside db we create a file connectDB.js
         next create a folder at the root of the project "models" the a file Users.js for our entities
         next create a folder at the root of the project for route called routes and then create a file auth.js
          This folderis used for creation of path: Router = Path 
         next is the creation of the folder controller then a file auth.js for the registration of the Users
          next is for the login still in the folder controllers (What is an envirmoment variable) 
         creation of the server.js
